            <p id="abt-text">I’m a student developper and a tech enthusiast with a strong interest in game development and hardware functionality. I enjoy working independently, I often take projects that challenge me to learn and build from the ground up. My approach  blends creativity with logic, allowing me to develop solutions that are both functional and thoughtfully structured. I’m trying to continually expand my skills through self-initiated projects and consistent daily practice.</p>
